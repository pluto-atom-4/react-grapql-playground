**Complexity**: Medium  
**Components**: 5 new (Tabs, BuildOverviewTab, BuildPartsTab, BuildTestRunsTab, BuildHistoryTab)  
**Hooks**: 1 new (useBuildTabs)  
**Files Modified**: 1 (build-detail-modal.tsx)  
**Testing**: ~6 test files, >80% coverage  
**Depends On**: Issue #258 (patterns)  

**Success Looks Like**:
- Tabs render all 4 content areas
- Tab switching works (click and keyboard)
- Count badges show on tab labels
- Lazy loading improves performance
- Full keyboard navigation and accessibility

---

### Parallel Execution

**Team**: 2 developers (1 per issue)  
**Duration**: 1-2 days wall time  
**Effort**: 5-7 hours combined  
**File Conflicts**: ZERO (different components)  
**Merge Sequence**: #259 first → #260 rebase → #260 second  

**Key Coordination Point**: `build-detail-modal.tsx` integration  
- #259 integrates ActivityFeed (Day 1)
- #260 refactors to Tabs (Day 2 after #259 merges)

## Common Questions

**Q: Can we work on both issues at the same time?**  
A: Yes! They have zero file conflicts. See parallel execution guide section 2.

**Q: What if we miss the 3-4 hour estimate for #259?**  
A: Extend development time; adjust merge timing. Use daily standups to surface issues early.

**Q: Do we need GraphQL schema changes?**  
A: No. Both issues work with existing queries or client-side calculations. Confirmed in plans.

**Q: What's the accessibility requirement?**  
A: WCAG AA compliance required for both issues. See accessibility sections in each plan.

**Q: How do we handle real-time updates?**  
A: Apollo cache invalidation with refetch. See data requirements sections.

**Q: What if tests fail after merge?**  
A: Rebase, debug, and push fixes to same feature branch. PR auto-updates.
