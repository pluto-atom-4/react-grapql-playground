## Block 3 Executive Summary

### Overview

Block 3 focuses on **mobile responsiveness and adaptive UI patterns** for the Build dashboard. This addresses two critical user experience gaps:

- **Issue #261**: Tables collapse to card layouts on mobile, maintaining data density
- **Issue #262**: Modals adapt from overlay → drawer → bottom sheet based on screen size

### Timeline & Resources

- **Total Duration**: 10-16 hours (wall time: 2-3 days)
- **Team**: 1 developer (sequential execution)
- **File Conflicts**: ZERO (different components, no shared file editing)
- **Dependencies**: #261 → #262 (strict sequential)
- **Merge Sequence**: #261 first (Day 1-2), then #262 rebase + merge (Day 2-3)

### Success Metrics

✅ All 17 acceptance criteria from both issues met  
✅ Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors  
✅ Zero file conflicts  
✅ All tests passing (50+ new tests, >80% coverage)  
✅ Mobile responsiveness validated on real devices (iOS/Android)  
✅ Both PRs merged to main  
✅ Component patterns ready for Block 4

- Components: 2 (1 new + 1 refactored)
- Test Files: 4-5
- Coverage Target: >80%

### 2. Component Ownership & File Structure

**New Files** (exclusive ownership):
```
frontend/components/BuildCard.tsx              (NEW: 200-300 LOC)
frontend/components/__tests__/BuildCard.test.tsx

frontend/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.ts           (NEW: shared utility)
frontend/hooks/__tests__/useResponsiveLayout.test.ts

frontend/styles/responsive-breakpoints.ts       (NEW: constants)
```

**Modified Files** (careful refactoring):
```
frontend/components/BuildTable.tsx              (REFACTOR: split view logic)
├─ Desktop view: <table> element (unchanged)
├─ Mobile view: BuildCard.tsx component tree (new)
└─ Logic: `useResponsiveLayout()` hook detects breakpoint

frontend/components/__tests__/BuildTable.test.tsx (EXTEND: new test cases)
```

**Shared Utilities** (one-time setup):
```
frontend/constants/breakpoints.ts
export const BREAKPOINTS = {
  mobile: 0,
  tablet: 640,
  desktop: 1024,
  wide: 1280,
  ultrawide: 1536,
};

export const TOUCH_TARGET_MIN = 48; // pixels
```

### 3. Test Coverage Expectations

**Target**: >80% statement + branch + function coverage

**Unit Tests** (BuildCard.tsx):
- Rendering with all required fields (name, status, date, progress)
- Status badge colors (pending/running/complete/failed)
- Touch target sizes (48px minimum on buttons)
- Card header clickable and routes to detail view
- Responsive font sizes (sm: 12px, md: 14px, lg: 16px)

**Integration Tests** (BuildTable.tsx):
- Desktop: Table renders all 6+ columns
- Tablet: Grid renders 2-column layout
- Mobile: Stack renders 1-column layout
- Breakpoint changes trigger re-render (resize listener)
- Data updates reflect in both table and cards

**Accessibility Tests**:
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through card headers
- Screen reader: ARIA labels on status badges
- Color contrast: WCAG AA on all text
- Focus visible: Focus ring on clickable cards
- Tap targets: All interactive elements 48px+

**Responsive Tests**:
- Breakpoint 375px (iPhone SE): Single column
- Breakpoint 768px (iPad): Two-column grid
- Breakpoint 1024px+ (Desktop): Full table

**Key Metrics**:
- Effort: 12-16 hours (but blocked until #261 merges)
- Components: 3 (2 new + 1 refactored)
- Test Files: 5-6
- Coverage Target: >80%

### 2. Component Architecture & APIs

**BottomSheet.tsx** (NEW):
```typescript
interface BottomSheetProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  title?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  height?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'; // 40% | 60% | 80% of viewport
  showDragHandle?: boolean;
  onDragClose?: boolean; // Enable swipe-to-close
}

// Usage
<BottomSheet
  isOpen={showModal}
  onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
  title="Build Details"
  height="lg"
  showDragHandle
  onDragClose
>
  <BuildDetailContent />
</BottomSheet>
```

**DrawerModal.tsx** (NEW):
```typescript
interface DrawerModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  title?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  position?: 'left' | 'right'; // default: 'right'
  width?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'; // 40% | 60% | 75% of viewport
  backdrop?: boolean; // default: true
}

// Usage
<DrawerModal
  isOpen={showModal}
  onClose={handleClose}
  title="Edit Build"
  position="right"
  width="md"
>
  <EditBuildForm />
</DrawerModal>
```

**Modal.tsx** (REFACTORED):
```typescript
interface ModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  title?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'; // 300px | 500px | 700px
  backdrop?: boolean;
  closeButton?: boolean;
}

// New: Adaptive wrapper that detects breakpoint
// Returns: Modal (desktop) | DrawerModal (tablet) | BottomSheet (mobile)
```

### 3. Gesture Detection & Swipe Logic

**useSwipeGesture.ts** (NEW UTILITY):
```typescript
interface SwipeGestureOptions {
  threshold?: number; // pixels to trigger
  direction?: 'up' | 'down' | 'left' | 'right';
  onSwipe?: () => void;
}

export const useSwipeGesture = (
  ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  options: SwipeGestureOptions
) => {
  // Detect touch start/move/end
  // Calculate distance moved
  // If >= threshold, trigger onSwipe callback
  // No third-party deps (native Touch API)
};
```

### 4. Animation Specifications

**BottomSheet Slide-Up**:
```css
@keyframes slideUp {
  from { transform: translateY(100vh); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: translateY(0); opacity: 1; }
}

.bottom-sheet-enter {
  animation: slideUp 250ms cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
}

.bottom-sheet-exit {
  animation: slideDown 200ms cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
}
```

**DrawerModal Slide-In**:
```css
@keyframes slideInRight {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
}

.drawer-enter {
  animation: slideInRight 250ms cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);
}
```

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| #261 takes longer than 8 hours | Delays #262 start | Build test infrastructure first; pare down swipe actions (optional) |
| Responsive breakpoints conflict | Breaks other UI | Isolate `useResponsiveLayout` hook; test across all pages |
| Gesture detection not smooth | Poor UX on mobile | Use native Touch API, test on real devices early |
| Focus trapping fails | Accessibility blocker | Use `react-focus-lock` or manual trap logic; audit with axe-core |
| Merge conflicts after #261 | Rework required | Keep branches up-to-date; use short feature branch lifetime |

## Key Takeaways

### Block 2 Lessons Applied to Block 3

1. **Component Registry**: Each component owns its file exclusively (no conflicts)
2. **Test Isolation**: Global setup files prevent test interference
3. **Review Buffer**: 1-2 hours per PR for feedback cycles
4. **Design Review**: Responsive patterns documented upfront
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA required from day one, tested on real devices

### Unique to Block 3: Sequential Dependency

- **#261 must complete and merge before #262 starts**
- Reason: #262 uses responsive patterns from #261
- Mitigation: Prepare #262 during #261 review cycle
- Result: Single developer can execute both issues

### Quality Gates
