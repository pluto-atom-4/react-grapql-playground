## Routing Matrix: Tool Coordination & Conflict Prevention

### Path-Scoped Tool Assignment

| Path Pattern | Tool | Scope | Owner | When to Use |
|--------------|------|-------|-------|------------|
| `frontend/**` | GitHub Copilot (IDE) | Real-time inline completions | Developer (in-editor) | Single-file edits, components, hooks |
| `backend-graphql/**` | Claude Code (CLI) | Deep reasoning, resolvers, DataLoader | Architect/Orchestrator | Multi-file refactoring, query optimization |
| `backend-express/**` | GitHub Copilot (IDE) | Inline suggestions for routes | Developer (in-editor) | Route additions, middleware stubs |
| `**/*.test.ts` | Claude Code (CLI) | TDD, test-driven development | Developer (local) | Writing comprehensive test suites |
| `.claude/` | Claude Code (settings) | Configuration, hooks, skills | DevOps/Architect | Tuning performance, adding skills |
| `.github/` | GitHub Copilot (CLI) | Planning, orchestration | Orchestrator | PR feedback, workflow analysis |
| `docs/**` | Claude Code (CLI) | Documentation, guides | Tech Writer | Multi-layer documentation, guides |

### Escalation & Handoff Rules

**Scenario A: Frontend → Backend Coordination**
- Developer in `frontend/` encounters GraphQL issue
- Action: Escalate to Orchestrator (not direct CLI edit of backend-graphql)
- Reason: Cross-layer coordination prevents schema drift
- Example: "UI component needs new field from GraphQL" → Orchestrator → Architect designs query → Developer implements

**Scenario B: Single-File Refactor in Backend**
- `backend-graphql/src/resolvers/user.ts` needs tidying
- If <3 files affected: Use GitHub Copilot in IDE for quick suggestions
- If ≥3 files affected: Escalate to Claude Code CLI for deep refactoring
- Decision: Check AGENTS.md → Is this isolated? Yes → Use Copilot. No → Use Claude Code.

**Scenario C: Test-Driven Development**
- Writing comprehensive test suite for new feature
- Use Claude Code CLI (`/code-review`, `/simplify`, deep reasoning)
- Why: TDD needs multi-file context, test patterns, assertion strategies
- GitHub Copilot: Good for test stub, NOT for full test architecture

**Scenario D: Performance Regression Detected**
- N+1 query found in `backend-graphql/src/resolvers/`
- Action: Escalate to Architect (via Orchestrator)
- Process: Architect → Design DataLoader strategy → Developer → Implement with Claude Code CLI
- Reason: Performance fixes need system-level thinking, not inline completions

### Conflict Prevention: AGENTS.md ↔ .claude/skills/

| Conflict Type | Prevention | Authority |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Two tools suggesting different patterns | Check AGENTS.md routing first, follow path-scoped assignment | Path pattern determines tool |
| GitHub Copilot suggests against `.instructions.md` | Developer trusts `.instructions.md` (layer-specific), ignore Copilot suggestion | `.instructions.md` (checked-in rules) wins |
| Claude Code vs Copilot for same task | Claude Code: deep reasoning, multi-file. Copilot: inline, single-file. Choose by scope. | Scope determines tool |
| New skill conflicts with existing workflow | Check `.claude/settings.json` → `contextual` section for precedence | Settings determine load order |

### Tool Ownership Summary

**Claude Code CLI owns:**
- Architecture decisions (all agents except @developer read CLAUDE.md)
- Test-driven development and complex testing strategies
- Multi-file refactoring (3+ files)
- Performance optimization and bottleneck fixes
- Configuration and settings tuning

**GitHub Copilot (IDE) owns:**
- Real-time single-file completions
- Inline explanations and quick lookups
- Component/route stubs
- Comment generation

**GitHub Copilot CLI owns:**
- Planning and orchestration (`@orchestrator`)
- PR feedback and cross-layer analysis
- Skill invocation and workflow coordination

## Claude Code Best Practices for Agent Workflows

### Context Management for Large Decisions

**When Architect designs new feature**:
```
Load in parallel:
1. DESIGN.md (existing patterns)
2. AGENTS.md (role responsibilities)
3. 2-3 recent architecture PRs (current direction)
4. Layer-specific instructions (constraints)

Result: 15K context for complete picture
Timeline: 5 min to load context + 10-15 min to design
Outcome: High-quality design without rework
```

**Why**: Large-scale changes affect many files. Pre-reading prevents design rework.

### Parallel Agent Execution Strategy

**When Orchestrator coordinates developers**:
```
Setup parallel worktrees for independent tasks:
  Task 1: Frontend feature (worktree 1)
  Task 2: GraphQL backend (worktree 2)
  Task 3: Express backend (worktree 3)

Dispatch agents simultaneously (zero dependencies)
Monitor progress in parallel
Merge PRs in any order (independent changes)

Result: 60% efficiency gain vs sequential
Time: 3 hours parallel vs 5 hours sequential
```

**Key**: Verify dependencies FIRST before parallel dispatch

### Model Override Guidance

**Default**: Claude Haiku 4.5 (fast, cost-effective)

**Promote to Sonnet/Opus for**:
- ✅ Complex architectural redesigns
- ✅ Technology trade-off analysis requiring research
- ✅ Performance optimization from first principles
- ✅ Conflicting requirements resolution

**Stay with Haiku for**:
- Design decisions within established patterns
- Routine implementation guidance
- Code review feedback
- Documentation updates

### Decision Documentation Pattern

**Every architectural decision should document**:

```markdown
## ADR: [Decision Title]

### Context
Why needed (business/technical drivers)

### Options Considered
- Option A (pros/cons)
- Option B (pros/cons)

### Decision
Chosen: [Option X] because [key reason]

### Implementation
- Phase 1: [what to build]
- Phase 2: [what to build]

### Trade-offs
- Benefit: [what we gain]
- Cost: [what we sacrifice]
- Risk: [what could go wrong]
```

**Storage**: `docs/decisions/ADR-[number]-[title].md`

---

## Copilot Agent Mode vs Claude Code CLI

### Use Copilot Agent Mode When:
- **Issue intake & planning**: Orchestrator analyzing requirements
- **Cross-layer coordination**: Multiple layers need synchronized changes
- **Multi-person workflow**: Handing off between orchestrator → coder → reviewer → tester
- **Automated orchestration**: GitHub Actions triggering agent workflows

### Use Claude Code CLI When:
- **Quick fixes**: Single-file changes (typo, lint issue)
- **Local development**: Testing features locally before pushing
- **File exploration**: Reading code, understanding structure
- **Interactive debugging**: Step through errors, inspect state

### When to Escalate
If Developer encounters:
- **Architecture question**: Escalate to Orchestrator for re-planning
- **Cross-layer blocker**: Need Orchestrator to coordinate
- **Merge conflict**: Ask Reviewer for merge strategy

If Reviewer finds major issues:
- **Design flaw**: Return to Orchestrator for re-planning
- **Regression risk**: Escalate to QA for extended testing

---

## Escalation Rules

| Situation | Escalate To | Action |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Issue unclear / ambiguous | Orchestrator | Re-plan with stakeholder input |
| Code pattern violation | Reviewer | Check `.instructions.md`, reference DESIGN.md |
| N+1 query detected | Developer → Orchestrator | Redesign DataLoader strategy |
| Test failure post-merge | Tester → Developer | Hotfix on same branch |
| Performance regression | QA → Developer | Profile and optimize |
| Merge conflict on main | Reviewer | Coordinate rebase strategy |

---

## Agent Best Practices

### For All Agents:
- **Reference path-scoped instructions**: Always check `.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md`, `backend-graphql.instructions.md`, `backend-express.instructions.md`
- **Link to issue**: Every action should reference the GitHub issue #N
- **No long-running tasks**: Break work into phases, each < 60 min
- **Document decisions**: Explain reasoning in commit messages and PR descriptions
- **Verify quality gates**: `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check` must pass

### For Orchestrator:
- Always reference DESIGN.md for architecture patterns
- Estimate time per phase realistically
- Identify dependencies between layers upfront

### For Coder:
- One feature branch per issue (reuse for feedback fixes)
- Commit frequently (one commit per logical change)
- Run tests after every commit

### For Reviewer:
- Provide actionable feedback (not "this looks wrong", but "this can cause N+1 because...")
- Reference path-scoped `.instructions.md` when providing guidance
- Approve only when all checks pass and no outstanding issues

### For Tester:
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Document steps to reproduce any issues found
- Run full suite, not just changed areas (regression testing)

---

## Skill Catalog Integration

See **[SKILLS.md](./SKILLS.md)** for 74 indexed skills across 8 domains.

### Skill-Based Task Routing

**Orchestrator** uses skills to break down feature complexity:
- **Frontend Skills**: React Server Components, Apollo Mutations, Form Handling (14 skills)
- **GraphQL Skills**: Schema Design, Resolvers, DataLoader Pattern (12 skills)
- **Express Skills**: File Uploads, Webhook Ingestion, SSE Streaming (10 skills)
- **Testing Skills**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Integration Testing (11 skills)
- **DevOps Skills**: Docker, Postgres, CI/CD Pipelines (9 skills)

**Coder** selects skills matching current phase:
- "Implement GraphQL Schema Design skill" → Update `backend-graphql/src/schema.graphql`
- "Add DataLoader Pattern skill" → Implement batch loading for nested queries
- "Build React Server Component skill" → Create Server/Client component split

**Reviewer** cross-references skills when providing feedback:
- "This N+1 pattern violates DataLoader Pattern skill (see SKILLS.md)"
- "Use React Server Components skill for server-side data fetching (see SKILLS.md)"

### Skill-to-Path Mapping

| Skill | Recommended Path | Tools | Time Est |
|-------|------------------|-------|----------|
| React Server Components | frontend/app/** | Claude Code | 30-45 min |
| Apollo Mutations | frontend/components/** | Claude Code | 20-30 min |
| GraphQL Schema Design | backend-graphql/src/schema.graphql | Claude Code | 15-20 min |
| DataLoader Pattern | backend-graphql/src/dataloaders/** | Claude Code | 25-35 min |
| File Upload Routes | backend-express/src/routes/upload.ts | Claude Code | 20-25 min |
| Vitest Framework | **/__tests__/** | Claude Code | 15-20 min |
